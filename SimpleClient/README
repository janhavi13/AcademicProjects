APPROACH:
1. Initially all the parameters from the command are extracted.
2. Based on the -s parameter SSL or non SSL connection is opened
3. Secret flags are returned for a verified NUID.
4. If non registered NUID given as input then the server returns UnknownHuskyId


CHALLENGES FACED:
1. Collecting the SSL certificate Information from the server 
2. getting the python script to run as shell script

TESTING:
1. Tested for all valid and invalid parameters in the linux command
2. Checked if the secret flags are different for SSL and non SSL connection for the same NUID

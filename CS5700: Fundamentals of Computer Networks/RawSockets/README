HIGH LEVEL APPROACH:
1. Socket is created for sending and receiving data
2. Handshake created between server and receiver with SYN , SYN-ACK and ACK packet exchanged
3. If the SYN-ACK is not received within 1 minute then the receiver resends the request
4. Data transmission begins after the handshake in which the receiver acknowledges every packet sent by the sender
5. If the checksum of the received packet does not match the calculated checksum discard the packet and resend the request for the same packet
6. If the data is not received within 3 minutes then the receiver times out and breaks the connection
7. Finally, when the server sends a FIN ACK , the receiver sends an ACK followed by a FINACK to end the connection
8. If the request is not a HTTP 200 OK then discard the request and print an error message in the consosle
9. Validate the Sequence number 
10. Check if the md5 value for the downloaded file and the original file is equal

TCP FEATURES:
1. TCP Handshake 
2. In Order delivery
3. TCP and IP checksum calculation
4. TCP Teardown Connection 
5. Checksum validation and Calculation

IP FEATURES:
1. Calculating Checksum
2. Validating Checksum


CHALLENGES FACED:
1. Setting up the Handshake and getting the correct sequence number and sending the correct acknowledgement number
2. Validating the checksum
3. Generating the correct checksum for packets with options 
4. Validating the sequence and acknowledgement number 
5. Retransmission of the ACK packet

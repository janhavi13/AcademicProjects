High level approach: 

1. Login to the website using an HTTP POST request by passing csrftoken and sessionid provided by the /account/login page
2. Parse the URLs on /fakebook/ using an HTMLParser. Store the visited url in a dictionary.
4. Then continue to the next URL from the array of all urls to be visited
5. On every page search if a secret_flag is present.
6. If a flag is found push it to a secret_flag array. Stop the loop once 5 flags are found.
7. If the GET request returns an HTTP response with a status code 200 , crawl the page
8. If the GET request returns an HTTP response with a status code between 400-500, it is a fatal error and webcrawler terminates
9. If the GET request returns an HTTP response with a status code as 500, it is a server error

Challenges:
1. Parsing the HTTP responses
2. Handling all response codes for the responses

Tests:
1. 5 secret flags received
2. Secret flags different for each team member
